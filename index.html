    <h1>About</h1>    
    <p>
      Information Technology has transformed the way we live and will continue to shape our future. 
      It enables seamless integration across all aspects of life. Serving in the military gave me the opportunity to make a meaningful impact, 
      and I want to continue making a difference by contributing to the future through my passion for software development. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Solving real-world problems excites me. My journey began with successfully completing the Microsoft Software and Systems Academy (MSSA), 
      which laid a strong foundation for my technical growth. After MSSA, 
      I joined a company where I gained hands-on experience maintaining and updating web applications using a diverse set of technologies, including .NET, SQL, MySQL, Azure, AWS, Windows Server, Red Hat, and more.
    </p>
    <p>
      In January, I felt the need to further expand my skills and decided to enroll at ECPI University in the Software Development track. 
      This next step is helping me grow both professionally and personally as I continue to pursue my goal of shaping the future through technology.

      <h3>Project 1: E-commerce Web App</h3>
      <p>
        MyWebApp is a secure, role-based web application built using PHP and MySQL, following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. 
        It allows users to register, log in, browse products, manage a shopping cart, and complete checkout. Administrators can manage product listings, including adding, editing, and discontinuing items. 
        The application emphasizes session tracking, form validation, and transactional integrity.

      <h3>Project 2: C Financial Console app </h3>
      <p>
        This C-based project features a menu-driven financial tracking system that allows users to input income and expense data, view transaction history, and generate summaries including total amounts and counts. 
        It uses a custom data structure to store entries with fields like date, description, amount, and category. 
        The program supports reading from and writing to a CSV file for persistent storage, and includes logic to load existing data at startup and save new entries upon exit.
